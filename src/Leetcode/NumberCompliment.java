    /**
     * Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input: num = 5
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: num = 1
     * Output: 0
     * Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Constraints:
     * <p>
     * The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
     * num >= 1
     * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
     * This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
     *
     * @param num
     * @return compliment number
